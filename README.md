# OFD_Noidcore_Straight
What is noidcore?

•	Noidcore is the OOD x Eli Wu Neutron Solenoid powered version of the popular flycore platform!  This allows for native semi-automatic operation, and easy select fire with addition of a micro controller. 

•	Noidcore is a 90% complete blaster awaiting your new shell, design, or integration!  I’ve done all the work on flywheel spacing, pusher mechanisms, and even a complete magwell with detent or release! 

•	The goal of Noidcore is to allow designers new and old to focus on creating exciting new designs with a proven flywheel core that’s simple to build and has compact geometry to integrate
